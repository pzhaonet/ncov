> 西交利物浦大学健康与环境科学系的研究人员用短短数天时间搭建起一个“一站式”的新冠肺炎疫情信息网站，该网站从权威渠道实时抓取信息，并为全球访客提供可便捷下载的疫情数据包。

> The new data uses the combination of confirmed and suspected cases for all dates in the model, recalculating the cumulative total for all dates starting at the disease outbreak.

- [西交利物浦大学：模型显示当前中国新冠病毒病例数量呈下降趋势](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/news/2020/02/yiqingchengxiajiangqushi):

> 新数据使用模型中所有日期的确诊病例和疑似病例的组合，重新计算从疫情爆发开始以来的累计总数。

> They created a website to provide scientists, journalists and other researchers open access to data from across China on novel coronavirus and daily statistical modeling. "We hope that through the integration of information, we can provide more people with data sharing and fight the epidemic together," Zou said.

> One open-access data model published on Monday by scientists at Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University in eastern Jiangsu province also predicted a sharp decline in new confirmed infections next week before falling close to zero by February 23. However, the researchers warned there were many factors that could influence the model.
