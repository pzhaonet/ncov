## Introduction of the virus

Disease: New Coronavirus Covid-19

Source of infection: patients who are already with new coronavirus infection. Asymptomatic patients can also be contagious.

Ways of Transmission: Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main ways of transmission. Other transmission ways such as aerosol and digestive tract are yet to be confirmed.

Vulnerable population: Generally susceptible to all population. Elderly people and those with chronic diseases are more sick after infection. Children, infants and young children also have symptoms
Incubation period: Generally 3 to 7 days, up to 14 days. Infectious during incubation period, and contagious cases with asymptomatic are very rare.

Host: Wild animal, possibly Rhinolophus sinicus.

  'Daily increase of serious: ', ncov$seriousIncr,  "  \n\n",
  'Updated: ', as.character(ncovr:::conv_time(ncov$updateTime))
)
```
The number of suspected cases comes from the National Health and Medical Commission's data, which is currently national-wide data.
