<p>Difficulties on one side, resources from all sides.</p>
<p>At present, the epidemic of COVID-19 is outbreaking globally. Epidemic prevention materials in some places are seriously lacking, and they need to be imported from other parts of the world.</p>
<p>At the same time, some medical material manufacturers have not found a corresponding market.</p>
<p>Our website launches this section of “Epidemic Materials Information” to facilitate the smooth flow of information for buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>We are not Alibaba. We are the media for supply and demand of epidemic prevention materials.</p>
<p>Friends interested in adding product information to this website can scan the WeChat QR code to add:</p>
